# Speaker Cleaner & Water Ejector 📱💧

Speaker Cleaner is a specialized Android application designed to rescue your phone's audio quality. If your device has been exposed to water or dust, this app uses specific sound frequencies and vibration patterns to "shake" particles and liquid out of the speaker grills.

* **Manual Mode:** Adjust the frequency (Hz) yourself to find the "sweet spot" for your specific device.
* **Vibration Mode:** Uses the device's haptic engine to help dislodge stubborn dust.
* **Custom UI Widgets:** Features a sleek gauge view, frequency wave visualizers, and a 3D-styled interface.
* **Multilingual Support:** Translated into 12+ languages including Spanish, Hindi, Russian, Chinese, and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
